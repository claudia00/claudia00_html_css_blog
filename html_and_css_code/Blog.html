	<p>One of hobbies I enjoy is taking pictures of moments, that will endless inspire. </p>

	<p>My dream is to become a game developer, to give people what games as always given me perseverance. </p>

	<p>I want to take away a player momentarily, to show them who they really are. As a game developer this is my mission, to create challenges for the player and remind them they are persistent beings. </p>
